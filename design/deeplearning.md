    [Another course link](https://cs231n.github.io/) Learning notes for this are [cs231n notes](#cs231n)

#### Application
Reading X-Ray images, image recognition, speeches, self-driving cars.

#### Deep learning
Traing neural network.

Relu function: Rectified linear unit function:
f(x) = max(0, ax + b)

Take a housing price prediction from house sizes. The linear regression
can be viewed as a neural network of a single neuron.

More complex housing price models: size and # bedrooms -> family size, zip code -> walkability,
zip code + wealth -> school quality, family size, walkability, school quality -> price.
This model is a more complex neural network. hiden layer is family size, walkability, school quality.

#### Concepts
* Supervised learning: matching input to expected output.
Currently most economic value are from supervised learning.
    * Most lucrative ML is online advertising: displaying ads the user most likely to click on.
    * Speech
    * Image
    * Machine translation
    * Self driving

* Types of neural networks.
    * For home feature, Ads, usually use standard neural networks.
    * For image, photo tagging, use convolutional neural networks (CNN).
    * For sequence data like audio, usually use RNN: recurrent neural networks.
