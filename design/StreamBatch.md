### Stream and Batch processing

#### Concepts
Bounded and unbounded data: Unbounded means infinite datesets

Processing time and event time

at most once, at least once, exactly once

watermark, triggers, signals

fixed window, sliding window, session window

#### Points
Stream processing should be a superset of batch processing. Exactly once processing. Can handle unbounded data and provide approximate results.
