### Minimize risks in software architecture design
* types of risks
    * bad requirements (Wrong, inaccurate, greedy, not enough)
    * Don't match functional requirements (miscommunication, not enough communication)
    * Don't match nonfunctional requirements: performance, latency/throughput, fault-tolerance
    * Missed deadline
    * Too expensive to deploy. Not worth it.
    * Security risks
    * Could not keep up with change of requirements (hard to change, add new features,)
    * hard to scale
    * buy vs. build
    * Gradual, incremental deployment. Simulation. Agile.

* case study
    * Iridium
        * too expensive. Not enough customers.
        * Not functional enough (cannot use in moving car etc.)
        * Challenged by alternative product (mobile phone)

    * Segway
        * Too expensive. Not enough customers.
        * Usage requires licensing in some countries. Even illegal in some nations.

    * Microsoft Vista: Features not good enough:
        * Not significantly better security wise.
        * Slower than predecessor
        * Not compatible with certain PCs.

    * Gateway computer company: alow to react to new markets
        * not entering enterprise markets
        * not entering laptop business
        * diversifying into consumer business, but not enough profits.

    * HD DVD: Lost to alternative Bluray
        * lost major customers/distribution channels to alternative: film studios, walmart

    * Vonage (VOIP)
        * did not gain enough markets
        * patents settlement
        * legal challenges
